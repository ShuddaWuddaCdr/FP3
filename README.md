### Project Concept

* Idea 1: A simple calender that when one puts an appointment to a destination it actually gives the estimated time of arrival with a reminder on the day of the appointment. It will have a calender frame and a google map frame for the direction and estimated time of arrival.

* Idea 2: A mathematical parser/calculator/grapher that provides a service similar to Wolfram Alpha

### Libraries You Plan to Use 

Probably need GUI, Graphing, Net and some others to do either idea.
